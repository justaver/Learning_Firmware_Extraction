# **Learning Firmware Extraction**

### **Executive Summary**
This repository documents a short study on **firmware extraction using popular software and debug interfaces** (e.g., SPI and JTAG).  
The project explores how firmware is accessed, identified, and analyzed across different devices using both professional and DIY toolchains.  
All findings, source code, and supporting data are publicly available here for educational and research purposes.

## **Introduction**
This project serves as the culminating study for the VIP 25 course, building on prior exercises in embedded systems and hardware analysis.  
The central goal is to **understand and demonstrate practical firmware extraction** using accessible hardware interfaces and software suites.

Topics explored include:
- A recap of firmware structure, data representation, and toolchains  
- Comparing SPI vs JTAG extraction approaches  
- Identifying and reading Flash memory components  
- Evaluating open-source and proprietary extraction tools  
- Investigating how device architecture influences firmware formats  

**Thesis Statement:**  
Firmware extraction can be achieved effectively using affordable, widely available tools without relying solely on specialized professional hardware.

## **Methodology**
1. **Experiment Design**  
   Define the objective — e.g., comparing SPI vs JTAG extraction reliability or read times.  

2. **Setup**  
   Describe your connection topology (SPI pins, JTAG header mapping, serial interfaces).  
   Include diagrams or photos if possible.

3. **Procedure**  
   - Identify the Flash memory chip using datasheet markings.  
   - Connect the board via SPI/JTAG using the interface tool.  
   - Use software tools (flashrom, OpenOCD, etc.) to read or extract firmware.  
   - Record all logs, terminal outputs, and extraction times.  

4. **Data Collection**  
   - Save binary dumps and log files.  
   - Record read speed, success/failure, and checksum comparisons.

## **Experimental Setup and Data Collection**
*(To be detailed once data is available)*  

- Test boards and microcontrollers used  
- Connection diagrams (SPI pinout, JTAG connections, etc.)  
- Screenshots of software interfaces or terminal logs  
- Notes about hardware identification and extraction attempts

## **Results**
Summarize the raw outcomes without interpreting them:  


Add figures or tables as needed (each with captions and IEEE-style labels).

---

## **Discussion and Conclusion**
Interpret the results:  
- How did SPI vs JTAG perform under your setup?  
- Which toolchain was most efficient or reliable?  
- Were there challenges with access permissions, drivers, or chip locks?  
- What improvements could be made for future tests?  

**Conclusion:**  
Low-cost boards and open-source tools can serve as viable platforms for learning and performing firmware extraction in an educational or research setting.
